# NumMethods
This repository contains files to complete a variety of numerical algorithms relevant to computational physics and chemistry.

## Integrals
- integrals.py --> functions to calculate numerical integrals using the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, Romberg, or Gaussian quadrature method
- gaussxw.py --> calculates the integration points and Gaussian weights for performing the Gaussian quadrature method
- gaussquad_ex.py --> an example problem using Gaussian quadrature

## Linear Systems of Equations
- Substitutions.py --> functions to perform backward or forward substitution
- GaussElim.py --> performs the Gaussian elimination algorithm with partial pivoting
- Decompositions.py --> functions to perform the LU (with or without partial pivoting) and QR decompositions
- LUsolve.py --> performs the LU algorithm with or without partial pivoting
- eigQR.py --> performs the QR algorithm for calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix
